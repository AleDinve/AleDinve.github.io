I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in Numerical Analysis at SISSA, Trieste, Italy. I got my PhD in Information Engineering & Science at University of Siena in April 2024, under the supervision of Maria Lucia Sampoli, Franco Scarselli and Monica Bianchini. My PhD thesis focus on the theoretical analysis of Graph Neural Networks, proving in specific their universal approximation properties and investigating their generalization capabilities.

I'm also a musician, I got my B.A. in Violin in November 2015 under the teachings of professor Luca Rinaldi. I currently play with several orchestras around the Europe. 

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

My research interests focus on the theoretical analysis of Deep Learning Models and on Uncertainty Quantification for Scientific Computing; nevertheless, I always get interested in challenging tasks whose solution could improve life quality of people.

<h2>Personal lifestyle</h2>

I am a Christian, all my lifestyle is based on my faith. I enjoy playing a lot of instruments besides the violin: viola, piano, electric bass, guitar, ukulele, and last but not least, the mandolin. I really enjoy hiking, and I'm in love with the Swiss mountains!

<!-- PROVAAAAA
I am an <b>assistant professor (RtdA)</b> at the Department of Mathematics "Tullio Levi-Civita", University of Padua (Italy).
  
I received the <b>Bachelor degree</b> from the University of Pisa, Italy (2013) and the <b>Master degree</b> from the University of Padua, Italy (2016), both in Mathematics. I then pursued the <b>Doctoral degree</b> in Mathematical Sciences (Curriculum Computational Mathematics) from the University of Padua, Italy (2020).

My PhD thesis was focused on the modeling of shallow-water equations on general topography and on the implementation of suitable numerical schemes.

After the PhD, in 2020, I collaborated as <b>postdoctoral fellow</b> with the Department of Geosciences at the University of Padua, working on the modeling of 2D and 3D flow and transport equations in porous media in the presence of anisotropy. From April 2021 to March 2023, I was <b>Research Associate</b> at the Institute of Scientific Computing at TU Dresden (Germany), working in the research project group ["FOR3013: Vector and Tensor Valued Surface PDEs"](https://for3013.webspace.tu-dresden.de/). Since April 2023, I am holding the current position, within the [“RETURN - multi-Risk sciEnce for resilienT commUnities undeR a changiNg climate”](https://www.fondazionereturn.it/) project, MUR-PNRR Extended Partnership PE3, funded by Next-Generation EU. -->
